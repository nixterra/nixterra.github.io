## About this site

This site is about:

- being curious about how things work  
- finding stories in data, even small, messy, personal ones  
- using code to ask better questions  
- writing clearly instead of sounding smart  
- taking ideas apart and putting them back together  
- building a small habit of sharing what I learn

Sometimes it's a data project, sometimes it’s just a few notes from a book or experiment. The point isn’t to impress, it’s to understand.

## About me

I started out in content writing, but over time I grew more interested in the patterns behind the content: the data, the systems, the questions no one was asking.

Now I explore that space through small research projects, writing, and data analysis. Sometimes I write code to understand things better. Sometimes I write essays to slow down my thinking. Either way, this site is where I track that process.

### What I work with

- Python / Jupyter / Pandas
- Quarto (obviously)
- APIs, scraping, light automation
- Text analysis, small-scale data research
- Occasional zettelkasten-ish note structures
- A healthy dose of curiosity
