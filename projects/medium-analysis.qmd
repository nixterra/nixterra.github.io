### About This Project

I created this project to explore what drives engagement on Medium — using public data and hands-on Python analysis.

I analyzed ~1,800 Medium articles to uncover patterns in claps, reading time, and responses. This page walks through the full process, including:
	•	Cleaning and transforming the data
	•	Generating summary statistics and visualizations
	•	Extracting insights useful for content planning

All visuals and analysis are now fully integrated below using Python and Quarto — no external dashboards required.

### Tools & Skills

- `Python` (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and analysis  
- `Quarto` to publish analysis  
- `Data storytelling` — summarizing patterns into insights  
- `Strategic thinking` from a content manager’s view

---

### Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Medium Articles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/medium-articles-dataset){.animated-link}  
  Contains metadata for ~1,800 Medium articles: title, claps, responses, reading time, publication, date

---

### Key Findings

- **The Startup** dominates top clapped articles — strong brand power  
- Best-performing articles tend to be **6–9 minutes**  
- Most articles receive **<5 responses**, with a few outliers
- Engagement peaks in **early Q1**, suggesting seasonal behavior

---

### Why I Did This

This project simulates a real-world editorial question:

> “What types of stories perform best on Medium, and how can writers use data to plan better content?”

By combining public data, Python, and lightweight reporting tools, I aimed to show how a modern content strategist might use data.

### Analysis Summary (Python)
To start the analysis, I loaded the dataset and imported key libraries used for data wrangling and visualization:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.set(style="whitegrid")

df = pd.read_csv("data/medium_data.csv")
```
The data includes article metadata such as publication, reading time, claps, and responses. Next, I cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.

### Data Cleaning
Before analyzing the data, I cleaned and prepared it by:

- Parsing the publication date
- Filtering out articles with zero claps
- Calculating a new feature: **claps per minute of reading time**
  
```{python}
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], dayfirst=True)
df = df[df['claps'] > 0].copy()
df['claps_per_min'] = df['claps'] / df['reading_time']
```

### Descriptive Stats

```{python}
df[['claps', 'reading_time', 'responses']].describe()
```

### Visualizing Distributions
To understand the general spread and outliers in the dataset, I visualized the distributions of claps, reading time, and responses using boxplots. This helped surface skewed engagement patterns and typical article behavior.
```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))

# Claps
plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
sns.boxplot(x=df['claps'])
plt.title('Claps')

# Reading Time
plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
sns.boxplot(x=df['reading_time'])
plt.title('Reading Time')

# Responses
plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
sns.boxplot(x=df['responses'])
plt.title('Responses')

plt.tight_layout(pad=2)
plt.show()
```
Boxplots show that:

- Claps are heavily right-skewed with a few viral outliers
- Reading time is typically 5–10 minutes
- Responses are sparse, with most articles receiving very few
