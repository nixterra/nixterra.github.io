    "text": "About This Project\n  I created this project to explore what drives engagement on Medium ‚Äî using public data and hands-on Python analysis.\n  I analyzed ~1,800 Medium articles to uncover patterns in claps, reading time, and responses. This page walks through the full process, including: ‚Ä¢ Cleaning and transforming the data ‚Ä¢ Generating summary statistics and visualizations ‚Ä¢ Extracting insights useful for content planning\n  All visuals and analysis are now fully integrated below using Python and Quarto ‚Äî no external dashboards required.\n  \n  Tools & Skills\n  \n  Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and analysis\n  \n  Quarto to publish analysis\n  \n  Data storytelling ‚Äî summarizing patterns into insights\n  \n  Strategic thinking from a content manager‚Äôs view\n  \n  \n  Dataset\n  \n  Source: Kaggle - Medium Articles Dataset\n  Contains metadata for ~1,800 Medium articles: title, claps, responses, reading time, publication, date\n  \n  \n  Key Findings\n  \n  The Startup dominates top clapped articles ‚Äî strong brand power\n  \n  Best-performing articles tend to be 6‚Äì9 minutes\n  \n  Most articles receive &lt;5 responses, with a few outliers\n  Engagement peaks in early Q1, suggesting seasonal behavior\n  \n  \n  Why I Did This\n  This project simulates a real-world editorial question:\n  \n  ‚ÄúWhat types of stories perform best on Medium, and how can writers use data to plan better content?‚Äù\n  \n  By combining public data, Python, and lightweight reporting tools, I aimed to show how a modern content strategist might use data.\n  \n  Analysis Summary (Python)\n  To start the analysis, I loaded the dataset and imported key libraries used for data wrangling and visualization:\n  \n  import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/medium_data.csv\")\n  \n  The data includes article metadata such as publication, reading time, claps, and responses. Next, I cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.\n  Data Cleaning\n  Before analyzing the data, I cleaned and prepared it by:\n  \n  Parsing the publication date\n  Filtering out articles with zero claps\n  Calculating a new feature: claps per minute of reading time\n  \n  \n  df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], dayfirst=True)\ndf = df[df['claps'] &gt; 0].copy()\ndf['claps_per_min'] = df['claps'] / df['reading_time']\n  \n  Descriptive Stats\n  \n  df[['claps', 'reading_time', 'responses']].describe()\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  claps\n  reading_time\n  responses\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  count\n  2420.000000\n  2420.000000\n  2420.000000\n  \n  \n  mean\n  367.808678\n  7.495041\n  5.722727\n  \n  \n  std\n  679.184481\n  3.703285\n  12.958243\n  \n  \n  min\n  1.000000\n  1.000000\n  0.000000\n  \n  \n  25%\n  62.000000\n  5.000000\n  0.000000\n  \n  \n  50%\n  155.000000\n  7.000000\n  2.000000\n  \n  \n  75%\n  382.250000\n  9.000000\n  5.000000\n  \n  \n  max\n  11100.000000\n  43.000000\n  207.000000\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  Visualizing Distributions\n  To understand the general spread and outliers in the dataset, I visualized the distributions of claps, reading time, and responses using boxplots. This helped surface skewed engagement patterns and typical article behavior.\n  \n  plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))\n\n# Claps\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 1)\nsns.boxplot(x=df['claps'])\nplt.title('Claps')\n\n# Reading Time\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 2)\nsns.boxplot(x=df['reading_time'])\nplt.title('Reading Time')\n\n# Responses\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 3)\nsns.boxplot(x=df['responses'])\nplt.title('Responses')\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad=2)\nplt.show()\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Boxplots show that:\n  \n  Claps are heavily right-skewed with a few viral outliers\n  Reading time is typically 5‚Äì10 minutes\n  Responses are sparse, with most articles receiving very few"

Sometimes I write code to understand things better. Sometimes I write essays to slow down my thinking. Either way, this site is where I track that process.\n  \n  What I work with\n  \n  Python / Jupyter / Pandas\n  Quarto (obviously)\n  APIs, scraping, light automation\n  Text analysis, small-scale data research\n  Occasional zettelkasten-ish note structures\n  A healthy dose of curiosity"
