    "text": "About This Project\n    I created this project to explore what drives engagement on Medium — using public data and hands-on Python analysis.\n    I analyzed ~1,800 Medium articles to uncover patterns in claps, reading time, and responses. This page walks through the full process, including: • Cleaning and transforming the data • Generating summary statistics and visualizations • Extracting insights useful for content planning\n    All visuals and analysis are now fully integrated below using Python and Quarto — no external dashboards required.\n    \n    Tools & Skills\n    \n    Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and analysis\n    \n    Quarto to publish analysis\n    \n    Data storytelling — summarizing patterns into insights\n    \n    Strategic thinking from a content manager’s view\n    \n    \n    Dataset\n    \n    Source: Kaggle - Medium Articles Dataset\n    Contains metadata for ~1,800 Medium articles: title, claps, responses, reading time, publication, date\n    \n    \n    Key Findings\n    \n    The Startup dominates top clapped articles — strong brand power\n    \n    Best-performing articles tend to be 6–9 minutes\n    \n    Most articles receive &lt;5 responses, with a few outliers\n    Engagement peaks in early Q1, suggesting seasonal behavior\n    \n    \n    Why I Did This\n    This project simulates a real-world editorial question:\n    \n    “What types of stories perform best on Medium, and how can writers use data to plan better content?”\n    \n    By combining public data, Python, and lightweight reporting tools, I aimed to show how a modern content strategist might use data.\n    \n    Analysis Summary (Python)\n    To start the analysis, I loaded the dataset and imported key libraries used for data wrangling and visualization:\n    \n    import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/medium_data.csv\")\n    \n    The data includes article metadata such as publication, reading time, claps, and responses. Next, I cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.\n    Data Cleaning\n    Before analyzing the data, I cleaned and prepared it by:\n    \n    Parsing the publication date\n    Filtering out articles with zero claps\n    Calculating a new feature: claps per minute of reading time\n    \n    \n    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], dayfirst=True)\ndf = df[df['claps'] &gt; 0].copy()\ndf['claps_per_min'] = df['claps'] / df['reading_time']\n    \n    Descriptive Stats\n    \n    df[['claps', 'reading_time', 'responses']].describe()\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    claps\n    reading_time\n    responses\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    count\n    2420.000000\n    2420.000000\n    2420.000000\n    \n    \n    mean\n    367.808678\n    7.495041\n    5.722727\n    \n    \n    std\n    679.184481\n    3.703285\n    12.958243\n    \n    \n    min\n    1.000000\n    1.000000\n    0.000000\n    \n    \n    25%\n    62.000000\n    5.000000\n    0.000000\n    \n    \n    50%\n    155.000000\n    7.000000\n    2.000000\n    \n    \n    75%\n    382.250000\n    9.000000\n    5.000000\n    \n    \n    max\n    11100.000000\n    43.000000\n    207.000000\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    Visualizing Distributions\n    To understand the general spread and outliers in the dataset, I visualized the distributions of claps, reading time, and responses using boxplots. This helped surface skewed engagement patterns and typical article behavior.\n    \n    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))\n\n# Claps\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 1)\nsns.boxplot(x=df['claps'])\nplt.title('Claps')\n\n# Reading Time\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 2)\nsns.boxplot(x=df['reading_time'])\nplt.title('Reading Time')\n\n# Responses\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 3)\nsns.boxplot(x=df['responses'])\nplt.title('Responses')\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad=2)\nplt.show()\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Boxplots show that:\n    •   Claps are heavily right-skewed with a few viral outliers\n•   Reading time is typically 5–10 minutes\n•   Responses are sparse, with most articles receiving very few"
